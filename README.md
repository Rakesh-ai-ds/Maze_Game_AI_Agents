## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Levels
Edit `components/MazeEnvironment.tsx` and add new level configurations to the `LEVELS` object:

\`\`\`typescript
3: {
  walls: [
    { position: [x, y, z], size: [w, h, d], color: "#color" },
    // Add more walls...
  ],
  decorations: [
    { position: [x, y, z], type: 'tree' | 'rock' | 'crystal' },
    // Add more decorations...
  ]
}
\`\`\`

### Adding New Power-ups
Edit `components/PowerUps.tsx` and add to the `POWER_UPS` array:

\`\`\`typescript
{
  id: 'newPowerUp',
  position: [x, y, z],
  color: '#hexcolor',
  effect: 'Effect Name',
  duration: milliseconds,
  shape: 'sphere' | 'box' | 'octahedron'
}
\`\`\`

### Customizing Physics
Adjust physics parameters in the respective components:
- Player movement: `components/Player.tsx`
- Ball physics: `components/Football.tsx`
- Collision detection: Various RigidBody components

## 🎨 Customization

### Visual Themes
- Modify colors in `tailwind.config.js`
- Adjust lighting in `components/GameScene.tsx`
- Change materials in individual components

### Game Balance
- Adjust scoring in `store/gameStore.ts`
- Modify power-up durations in `components/PowerUps.tsx`
- Change level progression in `components/LevelManager.tsx`

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support with all features
- **Firefox**: Full support with all features  
- **Safari**: Full support (may require user interaction for audio)
- **Mobile**: Touch controls and responsive design

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

### Other Platforms
The game works on any platform that supports Next.js:
- Netlify
- Railway
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- AWS Amplify

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Audio not working**
   - Ensure user interaction before audio starts
   - Check browser audio permissions

2. **Performance issues**
   - Reduce particle count in `components/ParticleSystem.tsx`
   - Lower shadow quality in `components/GameScene.tsx`

3. **Physics glitches**
   - Check Rapier physics version compatibility
   - Verify collision shapes match visual geometry

### Performance Optimization
- The game uses GPU acceleration where possible
- Particle systems are optimized for performance
- Physics calculations are efficient with Rapier
